        <h1>Creating color palettes is hard</h1>

        <p>
            Whenever I designed a website, I always got hung up on colors. Of course, I tried
            searching for help online but all I ever found were color websites that were like
        </p>

        <blockquote><p>These 5 magic colors are all you need for your design!</p></blockquote>

        <p>
            I've used so many of those color palette generators, and they have never worked for me
            and I never knew why.
        </p>

        <p>
            But then I came across a book from the creators of
            <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>. If you haven't heard of Tailwind
            yet, you should definitely check it out! It makes writing CSS so much faster and more
            enjoyable.
        </p>

        <p>
            Back to the book: It's called
            <a href="https://www.refactoringui.com/">Refactoring UI</a>
            and it has been a real game changer for me. It's full of practical advice on how to make
            your website designs look better and it has a whole chapter on color.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've tried to utilize the knowledge from that chapter and created some color palettes
            that were actually usable and resulted in better-looking designs. But the process was
            still very time-consuming. Creating a color palette manually from scratch took between 5
            and 10 minutes.
        </p>

        <p>So I thought to myself: <i>"Why not create a tool that does this for me?"</i>.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                And that's how you turn a five-hour task into a one and a half month task. Because
                I'm a programmer. And that's what we do. ~<a

        <p>
            And with that legendary quote <i><b>Paletti</b></i> was born.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now all that's left is that you <i>give it a try</i>. I hope you find it as useful as I
            do. If you want a quick start, take a look at the
            <a href="/getting-started">Getting Started</a> page.
