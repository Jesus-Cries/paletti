# Paletti

Choosing the perfect colors for web designs is hard. And even if you know how to do it right, it still takes a lot of time. That's why I created Paletti.

Paletti is a user-friendly tool for quickly generating indivdual color palettes for web design and development.

The color palettes are based on principles from the book [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/), which was written by the creators of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

# Installation

Run the following command to install all needed dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

To start the application in development mode, execute the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will then be available at http://localhost:5173.
